# Breast Cancer Clustering and Classification

This project focuses on clustering and classification of breast cancer data. It includes data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature engineering, and machine learning techniques.

## Project Structure

- **Data/**: Contains datasets used in the project.
  - `breast_cancer_cleaned.csv`: Cleaned dataset.
  - `breast_cancer_feature_engineered.csv`: Dataset after feature engineering.
  - `breast-cancer.arff`: Original dataset in ARFF format.
- **Notebooks/**: Jupyter notebooks for analysis and modeling.
  - `eda.ipynb`: Exploratory Data Analysis.
  - `feature_engineering.ipynb`: Feature engineering steps.
  - `clustering_&_classification.ipynb`: Clustering and classification.

## Usage

1. Open the notebooks in the `Notebooks/` directory to explore the analysis and models.
2. Use the datasets in the `Data/` directory for your own experiments.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
